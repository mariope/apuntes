#### Learn to code with C-sharp on Mac: The best online courses

Now that you've got C# set up on your Mac, you're ready to start learning the C# language in more depth. There are a bunch of great sites, and online courses, ready to help. Here are some of the best to get you started:

* C# Tutorial for Absolute Beginners. This YouTube tutorial is a good way to get started.
* Udemy C# for Beginners. Udemy's C# courses are among the very best, and this is a thorough grounding in the C# language.
* Unity Scripting. Because Unity is one of the primary environments for using C#, it makes sense that Unity would have some good C# documentation. And it doesn't disappoint.
* Microsoft C# Programming Guide. It's no surprise that Microsoft has some great C# tutorials available either. You'll find some great information about C# on the Microsoft website.
