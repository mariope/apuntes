You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

**Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde** is the original
title of a novella written by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson
that was first published in 1886. The work is commonly known today as
**The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde**,
**Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde**, or simply
**Jekyll & Hyde**.
It is about a London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson
who investigates strange occurrences between
his old friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, and the evil Edward Hyde.

The work is commonly associated with the rare mental condition often called
"split personality", referred to in psychiatry as dissociative identity disorder,
where within the same body there exists more than one distinct personality.
In this case, there are two personalities within Dr Jekyll, one apparently good
and the other evil. The novella's impact is such that it has become a part of
the language, with the very phrase "Jekyll and Hyde" coming to mean a person
who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next.

### Blockquotes

Biographer Graham Balfour quoted Stevenson's wife Fanny Stevenson:

> In the small hours of one morning, [...] I was awakened by cries of horror
> from Louis. Thinking he had a nightmare, I awakened him. He said angrily:
> "Why did you wake me? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale."
> I had awakened him at the first transformation scene.


Quotes from "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde":

> Quiet minds cannot be perplexed or frightened but go on in fortune
> or misfortune at their own private pace, like a clock during a thunderstorm.
>
> -- Robert Louis Stevenson


> It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it.
>
> -- Robert Louis Stevenson

### Code n Code Blocks

The `white-space` CSS property is used to to describe
how white spaces inside the element is handled. Example:

~~~
white-space: normal
white-space: nowrap
white-space: pre
white-space: pre-wrap
white-space: pre-line

white-space: inherit
~~~

Many CSS properties take `<length>` values,
such as `width`, `margin`,  `padding`, `font-size`, `border-width`, `text-shadow`, ...

Some specific examples:

- `1in` is always `96px`,
- `3pt` is always `4px`,
- `25.4mm` is always `96px`.

~~~
html { font-size: 62.5%; }
body { font-size: 1.4rem; } /* =14px */
h1   { font-size: 2.4rem; } /* =24px */
~~~

### Options

When writing a post, there are 3 options you can add to the header.

1. **disqus: y**<br />
  If disqus is set to 'y', at the end of the post there will be a disqus thread, just like this one. To use disqus, you MUST [set up your own disqus account](http://disqus.com/).

2. **share: y**<br />
  An option for showing tweet and like button under a post.

3. **date**: 2013-05-06 18:07:17<br />
  Date is not a required header since Jekyll reads the file name for date, this was added in only for the **signoff time**. (as shown at the end of this post) If you don't want the signoff time, go into `/includes/signoff.html` and remove the `<span>`.
